# WooCommerce Mix and Match: Grouped Containers

### Quickstart

This is a developmental repo. Clone this repo and run `npm install && npm run build`   
OR    
|[Download latest release](https://github.com/kathyisawesome/wc-mnm-grouped/releases/latest/)|
|---|


### What's This?

Mini-extension for that adds a "Grouped Mix and Match" [WooCommerce Mix and Match](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-mix-and-match-products ). This product type groups multiple WooCommerce Mix and Match products together to allow customers to choose from different size containers before making their selections.

It should have probably been called "Variable" Mix and Match as it is meant to actually approximate a variable mix and match product with the different mix and match products as "variations".

The Mix and Match products appear as options in a loop when viewing the Grouped product and when "Select Options" for one is clicked the related Mix and Match product loads and can be configured, then added to the cart.

### Set up

1. Create a new product, and select the "Grouped Mix and Match" type from the product type dropdown selector. 
2. Then click on the "Linked Products" tab.
3. Begin typing the name of one of your Mix and Match products in the "Grouped Mix and Match products".
4. From the search results select the desired product.
5. Repeat 3 & 4 until you have all the related Mix and Match products you wish to group together.

* Note: This is exactly the same process as for core grouped products.
