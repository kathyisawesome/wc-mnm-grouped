# WooCommerce Mix and Match: Grouped Containers

### What's This?

Mini-extension for that adds a "Grouped Mix and Match" [WooCommerce Mix and Match](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-mix-and-match-products ). This product type groups multiple WooCommerce Mix and Match products together to allow customers to choose from different size containers before making their selections.

The Mix and Match products appear as options in a loop when viewing the Grouped product and when "Select Options" for one is clicked the related Mix and Match product loads and can be configured, then added to the cart.
